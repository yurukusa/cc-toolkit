## JSON output

For CI pipelines, dashboards, or programmatic use:

```
npx cc-session-stats --json
```

Outputs structured JSON to stdout:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "totalSessions": 3405,
  "totalHours": 102.12,
  "activeDays": 47,
  "totalDaysSpan": 50,
  "firstSeen": "2026-01-10",
  "lastSeen": "2026-02-28",
  "averages": { "perSession": 0.03, "perDay": 2.17 },
  "longestSession": { "hours": 3.89, "date": "2026-02-28", "project": "cc-loop" },
  "hoursByDayOfWeek": { "Sun": 20.27, "Mon": 17.2, "..." : "..." },
  "topProjects": [{ "name": "~", "hours": 89.47 }, "..."],
  "streak": 35,
  "healthWarnings": ["35 consecutive days of AI usage. Rest days exist for a reason."],
  "last7Days": { "hours": 24.72, "activeDays": 8 }
}
```

## How it works

1. Scans `~/.claude/projects/` for session transcript files (.jsonl)
2. Reads first and last line of each file for timestamps
3. Calculates session durations and aggregates stats
4. Includes subagent sessions (Task tool spawns)

**Zero dependencies. No data sent anywhere. Runs entirely local.**

## Health warnings

The tool flags concerning patterns:

| Pattern | Warning |
|---------|---------|
| Sessions over 3 hours | Your spine has opinions |
| 7+ consecutive days | Rest days exist for a reason |
| Average session > 2 hours | 90-minute focus blocks are backed by research |
| 6+ hours/day average | That's a full workday of sitting |
